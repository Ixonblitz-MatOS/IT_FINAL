Base Structure of HTML:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Tutorial</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
    </html>
Copy this into any new HTML file you create (until you can create your own designed for your website).

Syntax:
        <tag>Content</tag>
        <tag attribute="value">Content</tag>
        <tag attribute="value" attribute="value">Content</tag>
    There are many tags which can be found at: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/
    The important thing to remember is to use a / at the end tag(known as the closing tag)
    Some tags are self-closing and do not require a closing tag. These are known as void elements.
    An example is <img src="image.jpg" alt="image">. This tag does not require a closing tag.

The basic tags will be shown in the code below along with a picture of the output. The photo has the same filename as each file.
